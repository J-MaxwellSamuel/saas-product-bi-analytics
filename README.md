# Business Case: 
## Analyzing the Causes of User Growth Slowdown and Elevated Churn at NexLoom

## Executive Summary
This project provides a comprehensive analytics solution to identify the root causes behind slowing user growth and rising churn at NexLoom. NexLoom is a B2B SaaS knowledge-base + AI search platform used by mid-market teams to centralize documentation and support internal discovery. Using MySQL Workbench for data cleaning and transformation and Power BI for visualization and insight generation, the project analyzes user behavior, subscriptions, engagement, and support interactions.

The solution enables NexLoom’s product and leadership teams to understand who is churning, why they are churning, and where growth friction exists, allowing for data-driven product and retention strategies.

## Business Problem
NexLoom has experienced:
- Slowing pace of new user growth
- An increase in monthly churn rate
- Declining engagement among previously active users
  
These challenges result in:
- Lost recurring revenue
- Higher customer acquisition costs
- Reduced lifetime value (LTV)
- Difficulty forecasting growth
Without a unified analytical view, teams struggle to pinpoint whether churn is driven by product usability issues, pricing, onboarding gaps, feature adoption, or support experience.

## Methodology
### Approach
- Data-Driven: Decisions supported by metrics like churn rate, DAU/MAU, retention cohorts
- User-Centric: Focus on user lifecycle and experience
- Scalable: Relational data model supporting future growth
- Maintainable: Clean SQL transformations and documented assumptions

### Technical Stack
- Database: MySQL (MySQL Workbench)
- Analytics & Visualization: Power BI, DAX
- Data Format: CSV (raw → cleaned → modeled)
- Version Control: Git / GitHub

### Development Process

1. Raw data ingestion (CSV)
2. Data cleaning & normalization using SQL
3. Relational modeling (keys, joins, constraints)
4. KPI calculation (churn, retention, engagement)
5. Dashboard creation and insight storytelling
